    <p>This tool helps you contact your MSPs and councillors about the practical effects of the pavement parking ban on your street. You can personalise the content once it opens in your email client.

Politicians love to talk about behavioural change, modal shift, and nudging you towards the “right” choices.
This tool is here to return the favour.

Every email it generates is dynamic — the subject line, the phrasing, and the examples all change each time you use it.
That means they can’t:

    Dump it into a “template” folder.

    Send you the same canned reply they sent everyone else.

Think of it as a 20-minute city for their inbox:

    Compact, dense, and impossible to avoid.

    Brings reality directly to their desk.

    Designed for active travel… straight to their political conscience.

If they can use planning jargon to reshape your life, you can use this tool to reshape their inbox.
