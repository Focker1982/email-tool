    <strong>Why does this tool exist?</strong><br><br>
    This tool makes it easy to add your voice to the campaign — without needing to write from scratch. Every message it creates is unique, personal, and harder for MSPs and councillors to ignore or dismiss as copy‑and‑paste. That’s intentional. We want them to feel the pressure, hear the variety of real‑life concerns, and see the volume of opposition that’s building.

/* Issue sentences (with your latest tweaks) */
var issues = {
  emergency: [
    "Forcing all cars onto the road removes passing and turning space when seconds matter for blue‑light access.",
    "Once parking fills the carriageway, fire and ambulance vehicles struggle at pinch points and response times can slip.",
    "Critical space and turning circles are lost when the road is narrowed by displaced parking — that’s an emergency access risk."
  ],
  accessibility: [
    "Many residents, including the elderly and those recovering from injury, rely on being able to park near their homes. With limited legal alternatives, the ban makes daily life more difficult for people who already face mobility challenges.",
    "This policy creates unfair barriers for anyone with reduced mobility. There are no practical nearby alternatives for those who can’t easily walk longer distances, and the result is a less accessible environment — not a more inclusive one.",
    "The pavement parking ban overlooks the people it claims to protect. Those with walking aids, temporary injuries, or pushchairs now face longer, more difficult routes between their car and their door — often with no safe option."
  ],
  prams: [
    "On streets where pavements are already obstructed or uneven, full on‑road parking forces prams and young children into the carriageway, making every journey riskier.",
    "Families used to navigate safely with prams or young kids by sharing space carefully. Now, displaced parking leaves less road space and no safe workaround.",
    "Rather than protecting families, this policy pushes children and prams into live traffic where partial kerb parking once gave them a buffer."
  ],
  bins: [
    "The current setup makes waste collection harder, not easier. Large vehicles have to squeeze through narrow gaps or mount the kerb — increasing the risk of scrapes, delays, and missed collections.",
    "It’s obvious this layout puts bin collection at risk. Narrowed roads and awkward angles force council vehicles into difficult positions — often driving up onto pavements to get past.",
    "This ban affects not just residents but essential services too. Bin lorries will have more difficulty accessing streets fully occupied by on‑road parking, and damage to parked cars becomes more likely as a result."
  ],
  elderly: [
    "For older residents, having to walk further with shopping or mobility issues is a serious challenge. The policy ignores this reality and forces a level of physical strain that many simply can’t manage day‑to‑day.",
    "The distance between car and home now matters more than ever — and for elderly people, that extra walk isn’t just inconvenient, it’s a real obstacle. We should be supporting them, not sidelining their needs.",
    "If you live with limited mobility, even a short walk can be daunting. Removing nearby parking makes it harder for older residents to stay independent — and that doesn’t feel like progress."
  ],
  visitors: [
    "When family, friends, trades or local businesses can’t park nearby, everyday life suffers — from childcare and school runs to helping an older relative.",
    "Restricting short‑stay parking makes it harder for families to connect, friends to visit, and local services to deliver — it chips away at the fabric of community.",
    "Losing the ability to stop close to someone’s home undermines everyday support networks — grandparents helping with children, friends checking in, and local businesses or trades providing essential services."
  ],
  danger: [
    "Instead of improving safety, the new layout has increased tension on the road. Visibility is worse, space is tighter, and what used to be a calm residential route now feels more stressful for drivers and pedestrians alike.",
    "This policy hasn’t made our street safer. It’s created narrower lanes, reduced escape space for pedestrians, and made passing or reversing more dangerous than before.",
    "By forcing all parking onto the road, the policy increases the chance of collisions and close calls — particularly where visibility is already limited. That’s not what safer streets look like."
  ],
  blocked: [
    "We’re banned from using the pavement to keep the road clear, yet council bins block pavements for days at a time — reducing road space further when all cars are pushed onto it.",
    "Pavements can be impassable for days due to council bin storage, but residents are penalised for the same thing when trying to keep the street workable.",
    "It makes no sense to ban partial pavement use while council bins regularly block them — and now all that space is lost on the road as well."
  ],
  gardens: [
    "The pressure to find legal parking is leading some residents to pave over front gardens, harming drainage, biodiversity and the character of the street.",
    "More hardstanding means worse drainage, less greenery, and a less welcoming street scene — an avoidable side‑effect of inflexible rules.",
    "Driveway conversions are becoming more common, not because residents want them, but because they feel forced. The result is a harder, less green street with higher flood risk."
  ],
  blanket: [
    "The same rule is being applied to all streets, no matter their layout or history of issues. That’s not enforcement — that’s automation. Residents deserve better than one‑size‑fits‑all punishment.",
    "By criminalising parking that worked safely for years, this policy alienates responsible residents. Enforcement should be focused on real obstructions — not routine, practical parking.",
    "A universal ban treats all situations the same, regardless of context. We need flexibility and discretion — not robotic enforcement that ignores lived experience."
  ],
  consultation: [
    "This policy was introduced without meaningful consultation at the street level. Residents like us have been left out of the discussion entirely, despite being directly affected.",
    "There’s been no honest engagement with our community. People were not asked how the ban would impact them — they were simply told after the fact.",
    "A major change like this should include local voices. Instead, it’s been rolled out from the top down, with no opportunity to raise concerns before it hit the ground."
  ],
  opposeIdeology: [
    "I do not support the application of 20‑minute city–style planning where it restricts everyday access. This approach should be removed from local transport policy.",
    "20‑minute city frameworks should not be used to shape street‑level parking or access rules. They do not reflect the needs of residents in practice.",
    "I reject the use of 20‑minute city principles in local access planning. Where applied, they should be withdrawn in favour of practical, street‑tested solutions."
  ],
  blanket20mph: [
    "I do not support a universal 20 mph speed limit. It should be reversed in favour of targeted limits where they are genuinely needed.",
    "Blanket 20 mph zones are inappropriate and should be replaced with speed management based on actual local risk.",
    "This area would be better served by retaining existing speed limits. I do not support the proposal of a universal 20 mph speed limit."
  ],
  cohesion: [
    "Restrictions that remove informal arrangements can strain cooperation between residents.",
    "Changes to parking rules will create disputes over limited space and parking.",
    "Maintaining goodwill is easier when local solutions are supported alongside policy."
  ]
};

/* New dynamic opener variants */
const introVariants = [
  "Pushing all parking onto the carriageway and removing partial‑kerb parking narrows passing width without fixing blocked pavements. It isn’t working here.",
  "Shifting all parking onto the road has narrowed lanes and reduced passing space, making the street harder to use for drivers and pedestrians alike.",
  "Concentrating parking on the carriageway removed the buffer partial kerb parking provided. Day‑to‑day, our street is harder to use safely and practically."
