  <strong>Why does this tool exist?</strong><br><br>
  This tool makes it easy to add your voice to the campaign — without needing to write from scratch. Every message it creates is unique, personal, and harder for MSPs and councillors to ignore or dismiss as copy-and-paste. That’s intentional. We want them to feel the pressure, hear the variety of real-life concerns, and see the volume of opposition that’s building.

  const issues = {
    emergency: [
      "I’m seriously concerned we’ll see delays for emergency vehicles if this layout continues. Our street is narrow, and full on-road parking leaves little room for larger vehicles to manoeuvre. If someone needed urgent help, seconds could matter — and this policy increases that risk.",
      "Emergency access is being compromised. When cars are forced fully onto the road, services like ambulances and fire engines may struggle to reach homes in time. It’s not alarmist — just a real-world consequence of reducing space on already tight residential streets.",
      "By shifting all vehicles onto the road, this policy unintentionally narrows access for emergency responders. It introduces serious risk in critical situations, and I don’t believe that was the intention — but it is now the reality."
    ],
    accessibility: [
      "Many residents, including the elderly and those recovering from injury, rely on being able to park near their homes. With limited legal alternatives, the ban makes daily life more difficult for people who already face mobility challenges.",
      "This policy creates unfair barriers for anyone with reduced mobility. There are no practical nearby alternatives for those who can’t easily walk longer distances, and the result is a less accessible environment — not a more inclusive one.",
      "The pavement parking ban overlooks the people it claims to protect. Those with walking aids, temporary injuries, or pushchairs now face longer, more difficult routes between their car and their door — often with no safe option."
    ],
    prams: [
      "On streets where pavements are already obstructed or uneven, walking on the road has been the only practical option for families — especially during poor weather. But full on-road parking now forces prams and young children into much narrower, more dangerous spaces.",
      "Families used to navigate our street safely with prams or young kids by sharing space carefully. Now, with cars parked entirely on the road and pavements still blocked by bins and clutter, the route for pedestrians is riskier than ever.",
      "Rather than protecting families, this policy makes journeys more hazardous for those with young children. The usable space has shrunk, and prams now move through traffic where there used to be a safer workaround."
    ],
    bins: [
      "The current setup makes waste collection harder, not easier. Large vehicles have to squeeze through narrow gaps or mount the kerb — increasing the risk of scrapes, delays, and missed collections.",
      "It’s obvious this layout puts bin collection at risk. Narrowed roads and awkward angles force council vehicles into difficult positions — often driving up onto pavements to get past. That’s not safer or more sustainable.",
      "This ban affects not just residents but essential services too. Bin lorries will have more difficulty accessing streets fully occupied by on-road parking, and damage to parked cars becomes more likely as a result."
    ],
    elderly: [
      "For older residents, having to walk further with shopping or mobility issues is a serious challenge. The policy ignores this reality and forces a level of physical strain that many simply can’t manage day-to-day.",
      "The distance between car and home now matters more than ever — and for elderly people, that extra walk isn’t just inconvenient, it’s a real obstacle. We should be supporting them, not sidelining their needs.",
      "If you live with limited mobility, even a short walk can be daunting. Removing nearby parking makes it harder for older residents to stay independent — and that doesn’t feel like progress."
    ],
    visitors: [
      "We’re seeing far fewer visitors, tradespeople, and home support workers because there’s nowhere practical to park. This makes basic home repairs, health check-ins, or even family visits more complicated than they should be.",
      "Essential services are being disrupted. Without local parking, it's harder for tradespeople, carers or delivery workers to stop — especially on tight streets with time-sensitive work.",
      "The new rules create practical problems for everyday life. Hosting visitors or getting help from tradespeople now requires negotiating a maze of restrictions — and that discourages support and community interaction."
    ],
    danger: [
      "Instead of improving safety, the new layout has increased tension on the road. Visibility is worse, space is tighter, and what used to be a calm residential route now feels more stressful for drivers and pedestrians alike.",
      "This policy hasn’t made our street safer. It’s created narrower lanes, reduced escape space for pedestrians, and made passing or reversing more dangerous than before.",
      "By forcing all parking onto the road, the policy increases the chance of collisions and close calls — particularly where visibility is already limited. That’s not what safer streets look like."
    ],
    blocked: [
      "Pavements in our area are regularly obstructed by council bins — especially on collection days. It’s frustrating to be told we’re creating access issues when the pavement isn’t usable in the first place.",
      "Even before the ban, residents had to navigate around multiple council bins left out on narrow pavements. Penalising residents while ignoring that reality feels inconsistent and unfair.",
      "The ban claims to protect pedestrian access, yet bins — placed or left by the council — already make many pavements impassable several days a week. This double standard needs to be addressed."
    ],
    gardens: [
      "The pressure to find legal parking is leading some neighbours to pave over their front gardens. This damages local drainage, reduces greenery, and creates a colder, less inviting street environment.",
      "We’ve seen more gardens replaced with concrete as people try to comply. It’s an unfortunate environmental trade-off that hurts biodiversity and increases flood risk — and it’s a direct result of inflexible policy.",
      "Driveway conversions are becoming more common, not because residents want them, but because they feel forced. That’s not a sustainable outcome for our communities or the climate."
    ],
    blanket: [
      "The same rule is being applied to all streets, no matter their layout or history of issues. That’s not enforcement — that’s automation. Residents deserve better than one-size-fits-all punishment.",
      "By criminalising parking that worked safely for years, this policy alienates responsible residents. Enforcement should be focused on real obstructions — not routine, practical parking.",
      "A universal ban treats all situations the same, regardless of context. We need flexibility and discretion — not robotic enforcement that ignores lived experience."
    ],
    consultation: [
      "This policy was introduced without meaningful consultation at the street level. Residents like us have been left out of the discussion entirely, despite being directly affected.",
      "There’s been no honest engagement with our community. People were not asked how the ban would impact them — they were simply told after the fact.",
      "A major change like this should include local voices. Instead, it’s been rolled out from the top down, with no opportunity to raise concerns before it hit the ground."
    ],
    cohesion: [
      "Where neighbours once worked things out informally, we’re now seeing complaints, arguments, and resentment. The sense of community is being eroded by forced restrictions.",
      "This policy has increased hostility. People are reporting each other, questioning who left what note — and that’s not how strong neighbourhoods are built.",
      "Something as basic as parking used to be managed with common sense and courtesy. Now it’s turning into a wedge between people who live side-by-side."
