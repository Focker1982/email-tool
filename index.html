  const issues = {
    emergency: [
      "I’m concerned emergency vehicles may be delayed when all parking is pushed fully onto the carriageway. On many residential streets, that reduces manoeuvring space at the very moment seconds matter.",
      "Emergency access appears tighter when vehicles cannot use the kerb edge at all. Larger vehicles like ambulances and fire engines have less room to pass safely and quickly.",
      "Shifting every car fully onto the road narrows usable space for responders. I don’t think that was the intention, but it’s an outcome we should take seriously."
    ],
    accessibility: [
      "People with reduced mobility, temporary injuries, or pushchairs often need to park near home. With limited alternatives, the rules are making everyday life harder for those who already face challenges.",
      "For residents who can’t comfortably walk longer distances, the change reduces accessibility in practice, rather than improving it.",
      "Those using walking aids or managing health conditions now face longer and more difficult routes between car and door. That isn’t a more inclusive outcome."
    ],
    prams: [
      "Where pavements are uneven or already constrained, families with prams are being pushed to share narrower road space. That feels less safe than before.",
      "With all vehicles fully on-road and pavements still cluttered at times, the available space for prams and young children is tighter and more stressful to navigate.",
      "The intention was safer walking, but the practical result is prams moving closer to moving traffic on many streets."
    ],
    bins: [
      "Waste collection seems harder, not easier. Narrower passing gaps mean larger vehicles must edge through tight spaces, raising the risk of scrapes, delays, and missed uplifts.",
      "Bin lorries are having to negotiate narrower approaches, sometimes mounting the kerb to proceed. That doesn’t feel safer or more sustainable.",
      "Essential services are affected too. When the carriageway is fully occupied, access for waste vehicles is more difficult and damage risk rises."
    ],
    elderly: [
      "For older residents, extra distance between car and home is a genuine barrier. The policy doesn’t seem to account for that day-to-day reality.",
      "What looks like a short walk on paper can be a major obstacle in practice for elderly neighbours. We should support independence, not reduce it.",
      "Nearby parking helps older residents remain active and connected. Removing that option makes ordinary tasks significantly tougher."
    ],
    visitors: [
      "Visitors, carers, and tradespeople struggle to stop legally and practically. This complicates repairs, care visits, and family support.",
      "Everyday life is harder when there’s nowhere reasonable for carers or trades to pause. Tight timing and equipment needs aren’t reflected in the current setup.",
      "Hosting visitors or arranging work now means navigating restrictions that don’t fit real-world needs."
    ],
    danger: [
      "Rather than improving safety, the new layout can increase tension and reduce visibility. Passing and reversing feel riskier in tighter lanes.",
      "When all parking is forced onto the carriageway, sightlines shorten and close-call risks rise—especially near junctions and bends.",
      "In practice, narrower lanes and fewer refuge options for pedestrians don’t feel like a safer outcome."
    ],
    blocked: [
      "Pavements are often obstructed by council bins—especially on collection days. It’s inconsistent to penalise residents while this recurring obstruction isn’t addressed.",
      "Many pavements are already difficult to use several days a week due to bins left out. If access is the goal, that needs solving too.",
      "The policy’s stated aim is pedestrian access, yet routine bin placement already blocks pavements. That double standard should be resolved."
    ],
    gardens: [
      "Some neighbours feel pressured to pave front gardens to create driveways. That reduces greenery, harms drainage, and diminishes the street’s character.",
      "We’re seeing more hardstanding where gardens used to be, driven by necessity rather than choice. That’s a poor environmental trade-off.",
      "Driveway conversions are increasing because residents feel they have no workable alternative, which isn’t a sustainable outcome."
    ],
    blanket: [
      "A single rule is being applied to very different streets and contexts. That feels like automation, not proportionate enforcement.",
      "Parking that functioned safely for years is now penalised, while genuine obstructions aren’t distinguished. Flexibility and judgement are missing.",
      "Universal prohibition treats unlike situations the same. We need discretion that recognises local layouts and lived experience."
    ],
    consultation: [
      "There hasn’t been meaningful, street-level consultation. Residents most affected haven’t been properly engaged before rollout.",
      "People weren’t asked how the change would work in practice where they live. It arrived first, with dialogue afterwards—if at all.",
      "Major changes like this should include local voices early. That hasn’t happened in a way people recognise."
    ],
    cohesion: [
      "Where neighbours previously cooperated informally, we now anticipate more complaints and friction. That erodes a sense of community.",
      "This is creating conflict over limited space as people try to comply with a rigid rule. That’s not how strong neighbourhoods are built.",
      "Parking used to be managed with courtesy and common sense. The new approach is driving a wedge between people on the same street."
    ],
    blanket20mph: [
      "A blanket 20mph rollout is being applied regardless of local context or risk. Slowing traffic in high-risk areas makes sense; applying the same rule everywhere without clear evidence or an enforcement focus is harder to justify—especially alongside the parking changes."
