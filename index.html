    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong><br>
      The pavement parking ban was designed with good intentions, but it’s causing real-world harm on residential streets. Emergency access, bin collections, and social cohesion are being put at risk, while councils overlook their own pavement obstructions. If the cost of policing this law is social division, unsafe streets, and unworkable living conditions, then it must be rethought.

const issueParagraphs = {
  emergency: [
    "I’m seriously concerned we’ll see situations where emergency services are delayed. On narrow streets like ours, full on-road parking restricts access and could endanger lives in a crisis.",
    "This policy risks delaying ambulances and fire engines when every second matters. Residents should not have to wonder whether help can get through in an emergency.",
    "Streets like ours were never designed for this kind of traffic squeeze. It’s only a matter of time before emergency vehicles are blocked — with consequences no one wants to see."
  ],
  children: [
    "For years, partially using the pavement allowed families to move safely. Now, with full on-road parking, prams and children are squeezed into dangerous, reduced spaces.",
    "Residential streets already have narrow pavements and poor visibility. With no safe walking margin, parents are being forced into live traffic lanes with buggies and toddlers.",
    "This creates a daily risk to children. In bad weather, or with limited sightlines, parents are stuck choosing between walking in traffic or staying indoors."
  ],
  bins: [
    "Waste collection is clearly going to be disrupted. Narrowed access means bin lorries will likely be forced to mount pavements, scraping past parked cars, or skipping homes altogether.",
    "The result is predictable: missed bins, annoyed residents, and more complaints. And when collections do happen, the risk of vehicle damage rises dramatically.",
    "This is already leading to strained services. Drivers now have to navigate tighter spaces — risking property damage and slower routes."
  ],
  visitors: [
    "Friends and relatives now struggle to visit, and tradespeople are cancelling jobs. Not every home has a drive or space for off-road access.",
    "People shouldn’t have to decline family visits or turn away essential repairs because there’s nowhere legal to stop.",
    "This policy is isolating the elderly, new parents, and people reliant on carers. It’s simply not realistic in many parts of the country."
  ],
  danger: [
    "By forcing all parking onto the road, the policy increases the chance of collisions and close calls — particularly where visibility is already limited.",
    "Instead of improving safety, this layout has increased tension on the road. Visibility is worse, space is tighter, and stress is up for drivers and pedestrians.",
    "The safety trade-off is backwards. A system that looked manageable before is now frustrating and unpredictable."
  ],
  blocked: [
    "The ban claims to protect pedestrian access, yet bins — placed or left by the council — already make many pavements impassable several days a week.",
    "Even before the ban, residents had to navigate around multiple council bins left out on narrow pavements. Penalising residents while ignoring that reality feels unfair.",
    "Pavements in our area are regularly obstructed by council bins — especially on collection days. It’s frustrating to be told we’re causing access issues when the pavement isn’t usable in the first place."
  ],
  gardens: [
    "The pressure to find legal parking is leading some neighbours to pave over their front gardens. This damages local drainage and reduces greenery.",
    "We’ve seen more gardens replaced with concrete. It’s an environmental trade-off that hurts biodiversity and increases flood risk — and it’s a direct result of inflexible policy.",
    "Driveway conversions are becoming more common, not because residents want them, but because they feel forced. That’s not sustainable."
  ],
  blanket: [
    "The same rule is being applied to all streets, no matter their layout or history of issues. That’s not enforcement — that’s automation. Residents deserve better.",
    "By criminalising parking that worked safely for years, this policy alienates responsible residents. Enforcement should be focused on real obstructions — not practical habits.",
    "A universal ban treats all situations the same, regardless of context. We need flexibility and discretion — not robotic enforcement that ignores lived experience."
  ],
  consultation: [
    "This policy was introduced without meaningful consultation at the street level. Residents like us have been left out of the discussion entirely.",
    "There’s been no honest engagement with our community. People were not asked how the ban would impact them — they were simply told after the fact.",
    "A major change like this should include local voices. Instead, it’s been rolled out from the top down, with no opportunity to raise concerns before it hit the ground."
  ],
  cohesion: [
    "Where neighbours once worked things out informally, we’re now seeing complaints, arguments, and resentment. The sense of community is being eroded.",
    "This policy has increased hostility. People are reporting each other, questioning who left what note — and that’s not how strong neighbourhoods are built.",
    "Parking used to be managed with common sense and courtesy. Now it’s turning into a wedge between people who live side-by-side."
