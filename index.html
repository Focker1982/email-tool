  <h1>Challenge the Pavement Parking Ban</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    Scotland’s blanket pavement parking ban is affecting communities in ways the government didn’t anticipate. Many streets are now less safe, less accessible, and more stressful for everyday families — all while councils continue to block pavements with bins and fail to provide alternatives.<br><br>
    Use this tool to email your MSP or councillor with real, lived concerns — in your own words — about what’s happening on your street.

    <strong>Why this matters:</strong><br>
    The pavement parking ban was designed with good intentions, but it’s causing real-world harm on residential streets. Emergency access, bin collections, and social cohesion are being put at risk, while councils overlook their own pavement obstructions. If the cost of policing this law is social division, unsafe streets, and unworkable living conditions, then it must be rethought.

        "Children and prams are being pushed into the road due to pavement narrowness — previously, careful shared use avoided this.",
        "On streets with poor pavement conditions, people with prams now have no option but to walk on the road alongside moving cars.",
        "This change forces vulnerable pedestrians into reduced road space, making things worse than before."
      ],
      bins: [
        "Bin collections are already being disrupted, and vehicle scrapes are becoming more likely as roads narrow with full on-road parking.",
        "It’s obvious bin lorries will struggle to get through without mounting pavements, risking damage and missed collections.",

        "The road feels more dangerous now than before, with congestion, stress and tension rising.",
        "The changes have increased traffic danger, not reduced it.",
        "Slower speeds don’t mean safer streets when people are boxed into tight, hostile layouts."
      ],
      councilbins: [
        "Councils still obstruct pavements with bins on collection days, yet they claim this ban is about accessibility.",
        "Multiple bins block pavements across the area and no attempt is made to reduce this.",
        "If pavements are to be protected, councils must lead by example and stop blocking them first."
      ],
      gardens: [
        "Neighbours are already ripping up gardens to install driveways, which harms green space and increases flood risk.",
        "The policy incentivises paving over lawns — bad for drainage and the environment.",
        "We’re replacing community greenery with concrete because the system allows no workable compromise."
      ],
      blanket: [
        "Blanket enforcement punishes everyone instead of targeting the few inconsiderate parkers.",
        "The system assumes all pavement parking is bad when many streets had practical shared use arrangements.",
        "There was no effort to distinguish between harmful and harmless situations."
      ],
      consultation: [
        "No one from my street was asked about this.",
