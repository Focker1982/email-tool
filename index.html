  // ===== Issues text (softened, professional tone) =====
  const issues = {
    emergency: [
      "I‚Äôm concerned that emergency access could be made more difficult where roads are narrowed by full on‚Äëroad parking. On tight residential streets, even small delays can matter in urgent situations.",
      "Emergency vehicles may face unnecessary delays when manoeuvring through streets with reduced passing space. This is a practical risk we should seek to avoid.",
      "By shifting all vehicles onto the road, access for larger response vehicles could be tightened, potentially slowing attendance when it matters most."
    ],
    accessibility: [
      "Many residents, including older people and those recovering from injury, rely on being able to park near their homes. With limited legal alternatives, the ban may create unintended barriers to everyday life.",
      "Accessibility needs may not be fully accommodated. For people with reduced mobility, longer walks to and from legal parking can be a genuine obstacle.",
      "The policy may not fully meet the needs of those it aims to help. People using walking aids or with temporary injuries can find routine journeys more difficult."
    ],
    prams: [
      "On streets with narrow or cluttered pavements, prams and young children may now be left with narrower, less comfortable space due to full on‚Äëroad parking.",
      "Families may find that careful sharing of space has become harder, with pavements still obstructed in places and the road space tighter than before.",
      "Instead of feeling easier for families, the route can feel more constrained for prams and young children where visibility and space are limited."
    ],
    bins: [
      "This layout may put bin collection at risk. Large vehicles have to navigate tighter gaps, increasing the chance of delays or missed collections.",
      "Narrowed passing space makes collection more difficult and increases the chance of minor damage to parked cars.",
      "Essential services such as waste collection can become harder to deliver reliably on constrained streets."
    ],
    elderly: [
      "For older residents, walking further with shopping or mobility issues can be a significant challenge. The current approach may not have taken this fully into account.",
      "Extra distance between car and home can be more than an inconvenience for many older people ‚Äî it can be a real limitation.",
      "Removing nearby parking options can make it harder for some older residents to remain independent day to day."
    ],
    visitors: [
      "The ban can make it more difficult for visitors, tradespeople, and support workers to park close by, complicating basic home repairs and essential visits.",
      "Without practical local parking, it‚Äôs harder for tradespeople, carers, or delivery workers to stop ‚Äî particularly on tight residential streets.",
      "Hosting visitors or getting help from tradespeople becomes more complex where local, short‚Äëstay parking options are limited."
    ],
    danger: [
      "Safety and visibility may not have improved in practice. Narrower lanes and reduced passing space can increase stress for drivers and pedestrians alike.",
      "On some streets, tighter road space and limited visibility could increase the chance of close calls, especially at pinch points.",
      "Where visibility is already constrained, concentrating all parking on the carriageway may not lead to safer outcomes."
    ],
    blocked: [
      "Pavements are often blocked by council bins ‚Äî especially on collection days ‚Äî which already reduces usable space for pedestrians. This seems inconsistent with the aims of the policy.",
      "In many places, bins left on narrow pavements make access difficult several days a week. Residents notice this alongside the new parking rules.",
      "The stated goal is pedestrian access, yet council bins regularly impede pavements. Addressing this alongside parking would be helpful."
    ],
    gardens: [
      "The pressure to find legal parking is leading some neighbours to pave over front gardens. This can reduce greenery and worsen local drainage.",
      "We‚Äôre seeing more garden‚Äëto‚Äëdriveway conversions as people try to comply. It‚Äôs an unfortunate trade‚Äëoff for local character and biodiversity.",
      "Driveway conversions appear to be increasing not out of preference, but due to pressure to create legal parking space."
    ],
    blanket: [
      "Applying the same rule to every street, regardless of layout or history, can make it harder for residents who have parked responsibly for years.",
      "A one‚Äësize‚Äëfits‚Äëall approach limits discretion and flexibility where local context matters most.",
      "Enforcement would work better with room for proportionate, context‚Äësensitive judgement rather than a blanket rule."
    ],
    consultation: [
      "Engagement with residents appears to have been limited. A more thorough local consultation would help identify workable, street‚Äëlevel solutions.",
      "A major change like this benefits from early, practical input from those who live on affected streets.",
      "A more open consultation process would capture local evidence and everyday impacts before decisions are finalised."
    ],
    cohesion: [
      "There is potential for more complaints or disagreements between neighbours as people try to adapt to reduced parking flexibility.",
      "Informal arrangements that worked previously may become harder, which can add avoidable friction on the street.",
      "Where on‚Äëstreet space is tight, new constraints can unintentionally put pressure on neighbourly relations."
    ],
    opposeIdeology: [
      "I do not support the use of the 20‚Äëminute city approach or similar centralised planning ideologies in shaping local transport policy. These frameworks can prioritise theoretical models over lived experience, accessibility for all, and the functioning of local transport and the economy. They should be removed from government policy in favour of measures that are practical, locally tested, and focused on safe, inclusive, and economically viable streets."
    ],
    blanket20mph: [
      "A blanket 20mph limit is being applied widely, with limited tailoring to local conditions. Targeted speed management at genuine risk points would better support safety without creating new challenges when combined with reduced parking flexibility.",
      "Slower speeds can help in the right places, but a universal setting may not reflect real‚Äëworld traffic levels and street layouts.",
      "A more context‚Äësensitive approach to speed limits would better balance safety with everyday movement and access."
