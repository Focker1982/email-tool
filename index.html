  emergency: [
    "Emergency access could be made more difficult where roads are narrowed by full on‑road parking, particularly on tight residential streets.",
    "Reduced passing space can slow larger response vehicles in urgent situations.",
    "Concentrating parking on the carriageway can tighten turning space for emergency services."
  ],
  accessibility: [
    "People with reduced mobility, including many older residents, can face longer walks between car and home.",
    "Everyday tasks become harder where nearby parking is no longer available.",
    "Accessibility needs may not be fully accommodated when alternatives are distant."

  prams: [
    "Parents with prams and young children have less room to navigate comfortably on narrow or cluttered pavements.",
    "Routes can feel more constrained for families where visibility and space are limited.",
    "Careful sharing of space has become harder, especially on tighter streets."
  ],
  bins: [
    "Waste collection can be less reliable where vehicles must squeeze through reduced gaps.",
    "Narrow passing space can increase the chance of delays or minor damage during collections.",
    "Essential services such as bin lorries may find access more difficult on constrained streets."
  ],
  elderly: [
    "Extra distance between car and home can be a genuine barrier for some older neighbours.",
    "Nearby parking helps many older residents remain independent day to day.",
    "The current approach may not fully consider the effort required for some older residents."
  ],
  visitors: [
    "Visitors, tradespeople and support workers can find it difficult to stop close by when short‑stay options are limited.",
    "Basic home repairs or care visits are harder to arrange without practical local parking.",
    "Local, short‑stay parking constraints complicate routine visits and deliveries."
  ],
  danger: [
    "Safety and visibility may not have improved in practice, with narrower lanes increasing stress for drivers and pedestrians.",
    "Tighter road space and limited sightlines can raise the chance of close calls at pinch points.",
    "Where visibility is already constrained, concentrating parking on the carriageway may not lead to safer outcomes."
  ],
  blocked: [
    "Council bins can block pavements on collection days, reducing usable space for pedestrians.",
    "Bins left on narrow pavements make access difficult several days a week in some areas.",
    "Addressing routine bin obstruction alongside parking would support the policy’s access aims."
  ],
  gardens: [
    "Pressure for legal parking encourages paving over front gardens, reducing greenery and local drainage.",
    "Garden‑to‑driveway conversions can alter the character of the street and reduce biodiversity.",
    "Some households feel pushed towards driveways rather than choosing them."
  ],
  blanket: [
    "A one‑size‑fits‑all rule leaves little room for judgement based on street layout or history.",
    "Residents who have parked responsibly for years can be caught by rigid application.",
    "Greater flexibility would allow proportionate, context‑sensitive enforcement."
  ],
  consultation: [
    "Engagement with residents appears limited; earlier local input would surface workable, street‑level solutions.",
    "Practical insight from those living on affected streets can improve outcomes before decisions are finalised.",
    "A more open process would capture everyday impacts and local evidence."
  ],
  cohesion: [
    "Reduced flexibility can unintentionally create friction between neighbours where on‑street space is tight.",
    "Informal arrangements that worked previously may be harder to maintain.",
    "There is potential for more complaints or disagreements as people adapt."
  ],
  opposeIdeology: [
    "I do not support the use of the 20‑minute city approach or similar centralised planning ideologies in shaping local transport policy. These frameworks can prioritise models over lived experience, accessibility for all, and the functioning of local transport and the economy. They should be removed from government policy in favour of measures that are practical, locally tested, and focused on safe, inclusive and economically viable streets."
  ],
  blanket20mph: [
    "Slower speeds can help in the right places, but a universal 20mph may not reflect real‑world traffic levels and layouts.",
    "Targeted speed management at genuine risk points would support safety without new challenges when combined with reduced parking flexibility.",
    "A context‑sensitive approach to speed limits would better balance safety with everyday movement and access."
