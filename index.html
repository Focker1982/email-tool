      "Children and prams are pushed into more dangerous roads where pavements are already inaccessible": [
        "On residential streets where pavements are already obstructed or uneven, the road has often been the safest path — especially during poor weather.",
        "For years, shared space worked without incident. But with full on-road parking, that same space becomes narrower and far more dangerous.",

      "Elderly residents struggle with the distance to parked cars": [
        "For older residents, having to walk further with shopping or mobility issues is a serious challenge. The policy ignores this reality and forces a level of physical strain that many simply can’t manage day-to-day.",
        "When parking moves further away, carrying groceries or simply reaching the car becomes a serious obstacle for many.",
