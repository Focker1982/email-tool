/* ===== Issue variants (kept long and specific) ===== */
var issues = {
  emergency: [
    "Forcing all cars onto the road removes passing and turning space when seconds matter for blue‑light access.",
    "Once parking fills the carriageway, fire and ambulance vehicles struggle at pinch points and response times can slip.",
    "Critical space and turning circles are lost when the road is narrowed by displaced parking — that’s an emergency access risk."
  ],
  danger: [
    "This policy hasn’t made our street safer. It’s created narrower lanes, reduced escape space for pedestrians, and made passing or reversing more dangerous than before.",
    "By forcing all parking onto the road, the policy increases the chance of collisions and close calls — particularly where visibility is already limited.",
    "Narrower lanes and tighter gaps are increasing driver stress and near‑misses, not reducing them."
  ],
  accessibility: [
    "This policy creates unfair barriers for anyone with reduced mobility. There are no practical nearby alternatives for those who can’t easily walk longer distances, and the result is a less accessible environment — not a more inclusive one.",
    "Those with walking aids, temporary injuries, or pushchairs now face longer, more difficult routes between car and door — often with no safe option.",
    "Removing proximity parking creates a bigger barrier for anyone who can’t manage distance or uneven routes."
  ],
  prams: [
    "On streets where pavements are already obstructed or uneven, full on‑road parking forces prams and young children into the carriageway, making every journey riskier.",
    "Families who used to share space carefully now find less road width and no safe workaround once all parking is pushed on‑road.",
    "Rather than protecting families, this policy pushes children and prams into live traffic where partial kerb parking once gave them a buffer."
  ],
  elderly: [
    "For older residents, having to walk further with shopping or mobility issues is a serious challenge; removing nearby parking undermines independence.",
    "That extra distance isn’t just inconvenient — it’s a real barrier for older people managing day‑to‑day tasks.",
    "Even a short walk can be daunting with limited mobility; removing proximity parking doesn’t feel like progress."
  ],
  visitors: [
    "When family, friends, trades or local businesses can’t park nearby, everyday life suffers — from childcare and school runs to helping an older relative.",
    "Restricting short‑stay parking makes it harder for families to connect, friends to visit, and local services to deliver — it chips away at community life.",
    "Losing the ability to stop close to someone’s home undermines everyday support networks — grandparents helping with children, friends checking in, and local businesses or trades providing essential services."
  ],
  bins: [
    "The current layout makes waste collection harder: large vehicles must squeeze through narrow gaps or mount the kerb, increasing delays and minor damage.",
    "Bin lorries struggle when streets are fully occupied by on‑road parking; incidental damage and missed collections become more likely.",
    "It’s obvious this layout puts bin collection at risk. Narrowed roads and awkward angles force council vehicles into difficult positions — often onto pavements to get past."
  ],
  blocked: [
    "Pavements can be impassable due to council bin storage, but residents are penalised for adapting to keep the street workable.",
    "We’re banned from using the pavement to keep the road clear, yet council bins regularly block pavements — and all that space is now lost on the road as well.",
    "It makes no sense to ban partial pavement use while council bins routinely block them; the result is less space on both pavement and road."
  ],
  gardens: [
    "The pressure to find legal parking is leading residents to pave over front gardens, harming drainage, biodiversity and the character of the street.",
    "More hardstanding means worse drainage, less greenery, and a less welcoming street scene — an avoidable side‑effect of inflexible rules.",
    "Driveway conversions are becoming more common, not because residents want them, but because they feel forced — leaving harder, less green streets and higher flood risk."
  ],
  blanket: [
    "A universal ban treats all situations the same, regardless of context. We need flexibility and discretion — not one‑size‑fits‑all enforcement.",
    "Applying the same rule to every street — whatever its layout or history — isn’t sensible enforcement.",
    "Parking that worked safely for years is being criminalised; enforcement should focus on real obstructions, not routine, practical parking."
  ],
  consultation: [
    "This was introduced without meaningful street‑level consultation; those directly affected were left out.",
    "Major change should include local voices and evidence before rollout.",
    "Residents weren’t asked how this would impact them — they were told after the fact."
  ],
  cohesion: [
    "Strict rules on scarce space strain community goodwill and cooperation.",
    "Removing informal arrangements over limited space creates avoidable disputes.",
    "Community cohesion is easier to maintain when local solutions are supported alongside policy."
  ],
  opposeIdeology: [
    "I do not support the application of 20‑minute city–style planning where it restricts everyday access; it should be removed from transport policy.",
    "20‑minute city frameworks should not shape street‑level parking or access; they don’t reflect residents’ needs in practice.",
    "I reject the use of 20‑minute city principles in access planning; where applied, they should be withdrawn in favour of practical, street‑tested solutions."
  ],
  blanket20mph: [
    "I do not support a universal 20 mph limit; it should be reversed in favour of targeted limits where genuinely needed.",
    "Blanket 20 mph zones should be replaced by speed management based on actual local risk.",
    "Retaining existing limits with targeted interventions would be more proportionate than a universal 20 mph."
